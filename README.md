## Strategic Recommendations
Address Mid-Quarter Drop-Offs: 
	Analyze the Jan–Feb revenue dip to identify root causes (churn, policy expiry, or low marketing activity).
	Launch Q1 re-engagement and retention campaigns proactively each year.
	Use predictive analytics to flag age groups or regions at risk of mid-quarter disengagement.
 
Maximize High-Value Age Segments:
	Double down on the 31–50 age group with targeted upselling and loyalty offers.
	Create value-based bundles like family plans or milestone-based coverage (e.g., career, retirement).
	Strengthen agent-led onboarding for 65+ customers through simplified messaging and personal assistance.
 
Boost Younger Demographic Engagement (18–30):
	Use gamified onboarding, influencer partnerships, and micro-payment options to appeal to the 18–24 segment.
	Deploy referral programs and digital loyalty campaigns for the 25–30 group to expand peer acquisition.
 
Optimize Sales Channels:
	Continue scaling online mode with smarter nudges like “Top-up now” or limited-time offers.
	Expand the agent network, especially in high-revenue cities, with incentives and CRM tools.
	Re-activate branch and referral modes via hybrid onboarding and metro-based referral drives.
 
Strengthen Regional Strategy:
	In metro cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad), offer localized campaigns and agent-targeted bonuses to sustain leadership.
	In cities (Chennai, Indore), run incentive-based acquisition programs to unlock growth potential.
 
Leverage Data for Product Strategy:
	Align product offerings by age group and geography (e.g., low-value/high-turnover plans for younger users).
	Monitor sales mode vs revenue behavior to fine-tune product placement and distribution strategy.
